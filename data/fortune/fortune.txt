;; ***** Special AI Seminar (abstract)
;; It has been widely recognized that AI programs require expert knowledge
;; in order to perform well in complex domains.  But knowledge alone is not
;; sufficient for some applications; wisdom is needed as well.  Accordingly,
;; we have developed a new approach to artificial intelligence which we call
;; "wisdom engineering".  As a test of our ideas, we have written IMMANUEL, a
;; wisdom based system for the task domain of western philosophical thought.
;; IMMANUEL was supplied initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdom
;; about such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and so
;; forth.  IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guided by the heuristic
;; rules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.  IMMANUEL
;; succeeded in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ideas developed
;; in western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those
;; underlying Plato's theory of government, Kant's metaphysics, Nietzsche's theory
;; of value, and Husserl's phenomenology.  In this seminar, we will describe
;; IMMANUEL's achievements and internal architecture.  We will also briefly
;; discuss our recent efforts to apply wisdom engineering to oil exploration.
